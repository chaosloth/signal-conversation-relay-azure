     AGENT: Hi Tom, welcome to the Sports Chat line.
     USER: Hey, thanks. I'm puzzled about last night's baseball game.
     AGENT: Which matchup are we talking about?
     USER: Yankees versus Red Sox. The seventh inning got weird.
     AGENT: Ah, the pitching change?
     USER: Exactly. Why pull the starter when he had only 80 pitches?
     AGENT: Manager wanted a lefty-lefty matchup with Devers coming up.
     USER: But the reliever gave up a homer anyway!
     AGENT: Right, that's baseball. Matchups are probabilities, not guarantees.
     USER: Got it. Anything else I should rewatch?
     AGENT: Check Judge's catch in the 9th‚Äîit saved the game.`;

     AGENT: Coach's Corner, this is Maya. What's your basketball question?
     USER: I'm designing a 2-3 zone for high school players.
     AGENT: Nice. What's your main concern?
     USER: We get burned in the corners.
     AGENT: Classic issue. Are your wings pinching too far in?
     USER: Probably. They collapse on every drive.
     AGENT: Teach them to stunt, then recover to the shooter.
     USER: Any drill recommendations?
     AGENT: Shell drill, but emphasize talk and close-outs.
     USER: Got it. How many reps per practice?
     AGENT: Start with five-minute blocks, three times.
     USER: Thanks! This'll help a ton.`;

     USER: There are two Park Streets‚Äînorth and south.
     AGENT: Oh, didn't know that. I'm at 512 North Park.
     USER: I'm actually 512 South Park, five minutes away.
     AGENT: Yikes! GPS failed me. I'll head over now.
     USER: No problem, call if you get lost again.
     AGENT: Will do. Anything tricky about the house?
     USER: Blue door, porch light on.
